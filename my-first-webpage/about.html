    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>This is the second for my basic HTML Website assignment and a short "About Me" section. 
        I recently moved from Vancouver, BC here to Toronto, ON. I completed one semester in a Computer Programming Diploma 
        while in Vancouver and am now continuing my studies at Humber Polytechnic. I am an avid PC gamer and harware enthusiast
        as well as an ameteur MMA fighter with a record of 3-0. I hope to make my pro debut by the end of the year.
